1.a)
    libnss is a set of open source crypto library where nss stands
    for network security services.

    libc is the standard C library that has the basic functions
    used by C.

    libdl functions are now within libc, however, libdl stays
    around for backwards compatibility.

    libtinfo is an offshoot of terminfo which contains functions
    of the terminal.

  b)
    Apart from the virtual page numbers, they are almost
    identical apart from one anon being 4K different and
    therefore the total is different by 4K.
    There is an anon that shares the same address, all others
    are different.

    The counter stops matching the intended value at 10,000.

  b)
    I think that it takes such large numbers, because initially
    each thread is just about in sync, but the tiny difference
    between them will start to get larger until there is a
    difference.

  c)
    Increasing the number of cores would cause the problem
    to occur sooner, due to using more threads so there are
    more options for things to overlap.
